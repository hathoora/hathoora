            # Server pool configurations:
            #
            # failover - When a server becomes unavailable then following logics is applied:
            #       default:  With default configuration in the event when server becomes unreachable, then following logic is applied:
            #                   Write: If master server is not reachable for write, then next writeable master (if any) will be used based on weight.
            #                   Read: If slave server is not reachable for reads, the next slave (if any) will be used based on weight.
            #                       1.  If there are no slave servers available then master read only server (if any) will be used based on weight.
            #                       2.  If there is still no read only master server, then next master with allow_read (if any) will be used based on weight
            #       custom: An array containing class and method to call. User can specify which db server to use.
            #                     This gives user the flexibility to pick a db based on  db health, concurrent threads etc..

            # DB server configurations:
            # role - In advance db setup, there are two types of roles:
            #   master - used for read and/or write
            #   slave - used for read
            #
            # read_only - (default: false) There is a 'readonly' mode which would not allow any writes to specified master db.  Read only masters are usually passive in nature, or hot stand by
            #   In read only mode data is not written to dsn and any query except for SELECT is ignored and result in empty result set
            #
            # allow_read -  (default: true)To  allow reads from master when there is no slave, no read only master db
            # Cannot use allow_read & rad_only for the master
            #
            # weight - For the same roles a database with higher weight is picked first.
            # options - Options for dsn adapter
            # on_connect - Any sql commands to run on connect
            # failover default
